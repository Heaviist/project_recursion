# project_recursion
The Odin Project's recursion assignments

# Assignment
Warm up by creating a method that calculates the Fibonacci series both by using iteration and recursion. Then build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

# Goal
1. Create a method to calculate the Fibonacci number using iteration
2. create a method to calculate the Fibonacci number using recursion
3. Create a merge_sort method using recursion

# Expectations and challenges
1. Should be relatively straightforward
2. Should be relatively straightforward
3. Might need to write some pseudo code first to get to grips with the concept. Not sure how challenging this will be after that.Up[date
