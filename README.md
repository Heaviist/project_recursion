# project_recursion
The Odin Project's recursion assignments

# Assignment
Warm up by creating a method that calculates the Fibonacci series both by using iteration and recursion. Then build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

# Goal
1. Create a method to calculate the Fibonacci number using iteration
2. create a method to calculate the Fibonacci number using recursion
3. Create a merge_sort method using recursion

# Expectations and challenges
1. Should be relatively straightforward
2. Should be relatively straightforward
3. Might need to write some pseudo code first to get to grips with the concept. Not sure how challenging this will be after that.Up[date

# Results and Evaluation
1. It was
2. Fibonacci was a good way to get a feel for recursions. I have used it in the hangman project, but on hindsight, that implementation might have been better as a classic loop.
3. The recursion thing seems to be like an acquired taste, the more you see it, the more you can appreciate it and the more you become familiar with more complicated flavours. It's in a way still a weird concept, as trying to think about it too much seems to break whatever you're trying to think about. Going along with it and seeing the magic happen seems more appropriate. I guess the human brain can see how it works, but isn't very well adapted to think all the steps through seperately without explicitly writing everything down. Seems to make sense to use computers for this kind of stuff. This project was also a good example of the value of writing pseudo code, from there the code itself basically followed with relative ease.
4. Quite happy with the seemingly simple, clear and concise code.

# Notes for future revisiting
Nothing much to add for the future. I guess it's good to go back to this repo at a later point if I need some inspiration regarding recursion.
